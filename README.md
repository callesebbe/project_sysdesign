Written in `Javascript`, `HTML` and `CSS`.


##App Description
The app contains 4 different workstations.
###1. Start Page
- Here you're able to chose which "workstation" you want to use the app with (kitchen, reception, bar). When you press one of the buttons you're redirected to that particular workstation.
- You can write who's responsible for the pub that evening. This will be visible for everyone using the system.
- You can write "comments" in the bigger box stating certain things. (i.e We're out of fries).

###2. Kitchen
- Here you can see all orders that the bar has sent. Yellow means not claimed, red means claimed.
- By pressing the order 1 time it will change status to claimed. Press one more time and it's back to unclaimed.
- By pressing the Done button, that particular order are removed from the system.(and shall be delivered to the customer).
